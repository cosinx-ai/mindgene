# MindGene
MindGene is a collection of AI models for Genes, RNAs, Proteins and Cells. It is trained on various public datasets and can be used for various tasks such as drug screening, cellular phenotypes modeling, animal and human disease modeling and health status prediction.
The models will cover the following areas:
- Disease cellular phenotypes modeling
- In silico compound toxicity and target prediction
- Compound efficacy prediction for a specific disease or phenotype
- Protein/kinase inhibitors prediction
